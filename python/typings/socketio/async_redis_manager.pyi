    """Redis based client manager for asyncio servers.

    This class implements a Redis backend for event sharing across multiple
    processes.

    To use a Redis backend, initialize the :class:`AsyncServer` instance as
    follows::

        url = 'redis://hostname:port/0'
        server = socketio.AsyncServer(
            client_manager=socketio.AsyncRedisManager(url))

    :param url: The connection URL for the Redis server. For a default Redis
                store running on the same host, use ``redis://``.  To use a
                TLS connection, use ``rediss://``. To use Redis Sentinel, use
                ``redis+sentinel://`` with a comma-separated list of hosts
                and the service name after the db in the URL path. Example:
                ``redis+sentinel://user:pw@host1:1234,host2:2345/0/myredis``.
    :param channel: The channel name on which the server sends and receives
                    notifications. Must be the same in all the servers.
    :param write_only: If set to ``True``, only initialize to emit events. The
                       default of ``False`` initializes the class for emitting
                       and receiving.
    :param redis_options: additional keyword arguments to be passed to
                          ``Redis.from_url()`` or ``Sentinel()``.
